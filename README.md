# Decentralization of [Paralelní Polis](https://www.paralelnipolis.cz/o-nas/en/)

The term cryptoanarchy describes the growing environment of the
unregulated Internet, where unlimited data sharing and the development
of the free market became possible by using anonymous tools such
as decentralized currencies like bitcoin, and anti-spyware encryption
tools.

From the intervention of a live broadcast of Czech Television to
the virtual interaction with politician’s mobile phones, we as
members of the Ztohoven group are associated with hacking. The
inspiration of technological innovation and its potential impact
on society led us to a tight interaction with the hacker scene.
As we understand the connection between the arts, science and
technology as a tool to highlight the authoritarian tendencies which
entered into our daily lives  with the development of modern
technologies, we decided to join the international hackers network
and to establish a hacker space called **Institute of Cryptoanarchy**.

The aim of the Institute of Cryptoanarchy is to make available tools
for unlimited dissemination of information on the Internet and
encouraging a parallel decentralized economy, crypto-currencies and
other conditions for the development of a free society in the 21st
century.

The main motive for us is the belief that censorship is not a
phenomenon only in “the distant dictatorial world”.

States and their security agencies globally control access to
information and use the protection of intellectual property as an
excuse to apply total censorship to control the available resources.

The State on a global level  processes private mail and personal
data, even though the European Court of Justice decided on the
illegitimacy of “data retention”.

The State and corporations have data on economic behavior, and
through  legislation they have received  complete access to all
payment transactions and consumer habits.

New technology brings the possibility of choice – we are in a time
that is defined by [The Crypto Anarchist
Manifesto](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/crypto-anarchy.html).

With a fast internet connection, reliable anonymity and decentralized
currency, you preserve freedom which we have been losing as a
society.

## What is it?

Paralelní Polis consist of several concepts that all aim at one thing -
helping people opt-out from the current authoritarian system.

In Bitcoin Coffee, people learn there is an alternative financial system
(we only accept Bitcoin and Litecoin as payment), we only play Creative
Commons music, there is no photography without asking permission. We
live the vision of free society and you can too, when you enter.

As you proceed in the house, you can be on top of things by going to the
top floor which is Institute of Cryptoanarchy. You can learn how to
increase your personal freedom. There are meetups about
cryptocurrencies, unschooling, biohacking, personal liberty, machine
learning, 3D printing, etc.

When you gain new skills and learn more, you can either proceed to
CryptoLab or Paper Hub and utilize your skills - you can create new
products, services and open-source projects to advance the human
liberty.

## Decentralize the decentralization movement!

We understand that as a physical space in Prague, we can mainly serve
people who visit us physically. To have higher impact on society, we
decided to open-source the concept itself, so you can open your own
Paralelni Polis.

There is a first child instance of this project, [Paralelná Polis in
Bratislava, Slovakia](https://paralelnapolis.sk/homepage/). As the team
in Bratislava is building another "copy" of the concept, we are
documenting all the steps required. This is the result of this effort.

We were inspired by the [Hackerspace
movement](https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/Documentation):

> "During the operation of a hackerspace, there are many questions and
> problems that arise from time to time. To save future spaces from having
> to find optimal solutions for common situations all over again, we're
> collecting a list of Do's and Don'ts here. Please add your experiences
> in the subsite for your hackerspace here. The goal is to collect the
> most common/best/creative solutions"

We believe that Paralelní Polis - although itself a form of a hackerspace - is
more focused on cryptoanarchy and blends in creative space with an
educational institution, educational cafeteria and a coworking space,
which makes it more sustainable and more impactful concept. We believe
that opening up more to random strangers that just come to drink coffee
and learn about this wonderful parallel world, we can have serious
impact on the society.

Using the know-how, tools, experience, software tools and support from
us, you can open your own Paralelní Polis in your
"[polis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polis)".
